# Souldity: Soulbound Tokens for Universities

Unlocking a new era of verifiable academic achievements and lifelong learning.

## Overview

Souldity is a platform that empowers universities to harness the power of Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to:

- Issue tamper-proof digital credentials: Issue verifiable degrees and certificates that students can proudly showcase and carry with them throughout their careers.

## Features

- Customizable SBT creation: Universities can design and mint SBTs with unique attributes and metadata to represent specific achievements, skills, and experiences.
- Seamless student onboarding: Students can easily receive their SBTs through a user-friendly interface.
- Secure storage: SBTs are stored on a decentralized blockchain, ensuring their immutability and authenticity.
- Verifiable claims: Recipients can easily share and verify their SBTs with potential employers, educational institutions, and other stakeholders.

## Getting Started

1. Universities:
   - Set up a Souldity instance for your institution.
   - Define the SBTs you want to issue.
   - Integrate with your existing student data systems.
2. Students:
   - Receive SBTs from your university.
   - Show off your SBTs with the world!

## Technology

Souldity is built on top of EVM compaitable Sepolia Testnet, leveraging its security, scalability, and decentralization features. It utilizes Solidity for smart contract development and supports ERC-721 for SBT implementation.
